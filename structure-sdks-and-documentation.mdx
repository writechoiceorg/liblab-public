{/* QUESTIONS

1- None of the SDKs we generated have a `documentation/snippets` folder. Is this new?

2- Is the Llama API being used as example real? If not, shouldn't we be using the Pets API here as well?

3- Its said the structure for GO is missing. As I could see, it difers a lot from the other ones. All others have `examples`, `documentation`, but for Go it's `cmd`, `documentation`, `internal` and `pkg`. Should it only be presented in the **SDK language-specific structures** section?

# Structure of the generated SDKs and their documentation

When creating new SDKs, liblab will generate a folder for each language you chose to create a SDK for. Understanding the generated structures will be essential for maximizing the benefits of the SDKs created by liblab, whether you aim to assist your end users in integrating more smoothly with your API or to effectively utilize the SDK in your own development work.

This guide gives an overview of the shared elements found in all SDKs created by liblab, as well as the specific language details for each supported programming language.

## Common SDK structure

The SDKs generated by liblab share a consistent structure across different programming languages, making working with multiple SDKs easier. Each SDK includes the following key components:

- **License**: The `LICENSE` file outlines the SDK's licensing terms and usage guidelines, ensuring that users understand their rights and obligations when using the software.
- **README**: The `README.md` file is the starting point for integrating the SDK. This file provides guidance on how to get up and running with the SDK and the API it wraps. The file's content is tailored to each SDK's programming language, ensuring that the examples and instructions align with the best practices of that language. It typically includes:
    - **Installation Instructions:** Step-by-step guidance on installing the SDK in the target environment.
    - **Authentication Setup:** Details on authenticating against the API, ensuring secure access.
    - **Sample Usage:** Code snippets that demonstrate how to interact with the API, allowing users to quickly understand and implement key functionality.
    - **Documentation Overview:** Links to more detailed documentation within the SDK, such as services and models, which provide deeper insights into the available API resources and operations.

- **Documentation Folder:** The `documentation` folder is a significant part of each SDK, containing detailed Markdown files for the resources and methods defined in the API specification. These files are linked from the `README.md` file to provide basic documentation on interacting with the API through the SDK. This setup becomes especially useful when you host your SDK on GitHub or similar code hosting platforms, as they render Markdown files, giving users navigable and accessible documentation. It contains the following subfolders:
    - **`models`:** This folder contains the API resources, representing the data structures defined in the API specification.
    - **`services`:** Documents the methods or operations associated with each resource, detailing how to interact with the API endpoints.
    - **`snippets`:** Provides [code snippets](https://developers.liblab.com/sdk-docs/sdk-docs-overview#sdk-snippets), either as multiple Markdown files or one single JSON file depending on your configuration. This folder is available only if you [configure liblab to include SDK snippets in the generated documentation](https://developers.liblab.com/sdk-docs/generate-docs#generate-sdk-snippets).

- **Example Folder:** To help you quickly get started, each SDK includes an `examples` (or `Example`) folder. This folder has [a simple, runnable example code](https://developers.liblab.com/get-started/quickstart-generate-sdk#run-an-example) presenting how to easily use the SDK to call an API endpoint. This code allows you to test the SDK without needing to build an application your self.

- **Source Code Organization:** Most SDKs include an `src` folder or one that's based on the [`sdkName`](https://developers.liblab.com/cli/config-file-overview-root#sdkname) value in your liblab configuration file. This folder contains the core implementation of the SDK, including the following folders:
    - **`models`:** These are classes representing the data structures defined in the API spec (e.g., `Llama`, `ApiToken`).
    - **`services`:** These classes contain methods to interact with the API endpoints, reflecting the operations specified in the API spec.

    > This organization makes it easier to locate and work with different parts of the SDK, whether you're implementing new features or debugging existing ones.

## Illustrating common SDK structures

Each SDK language specified in your liblab config file will have one folder per language. The liblab config file starts with the following languages as example:

{/* ADD DOCUSAURUS TABS HERE AND MAYBE ACCORDION*/}
For C#, this is the generated SDK structure:
```
csharp
├── Example
│   ├── Example.csproj
│   └── Program.cs
├── LICENSE
├── MyEx1Sdk
│   ├── ...
│   ├── Models
│   └── Services
├── README.md
├── documentation
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── ApiToken.md
│   │   ├── ApiTokenRequest.md
│   │   ├── Llama.md
│   │   ├── LlamaColor.md
│   │   ├── LlamaCreate.md
│   │   ├── LlamaId.md
│   │   ├── User.md
│   │   └── UserRegistration.md
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── LlamaPictureService.md
│   │   ├── LlamaService.md
│   │   ├── TokenService.md
│   │   └── UserService.md
│   └── snippets
│       └── snippets.json
└── install.sh
```

And this is Python's SDK structure:
```
python
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── documentation
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── ApiToken.md
│   │   ├── ApiTokenRequest.md
│   │   ├── Llama.md
│   │   ├── LlamaColor.md
│   │   ├── LlamaCreate.md
│   │   ├── LlamaId.md
│   │   ├── User.md
│   │   └── UserRegistration.md
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── LlamaPictureService.md
│   │   ├── LlamaService.md
│   │   ├── TokenService.md
│   │   └── UserService.md
│   └── snippets
│       └── snippets.json
├── examples
│   ├── install.cmd
│   ├── install.sh
│   └── sample.py
├── install.cmd
├── install.sh
├── pyproject.toml
└── src
    └── my_ex1_sdk
        ├── models
        ├── ...
        └── services
```

This is TypeScript's structure:
```
typescript
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── documentation
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── ApiToken.md
│   │   ├── ApiTokenRequest.md
│   │   ├── Llama.md
│   │   ├── LlamaColor.md
│   │   ├── LlamaCreate.md
│   │   ├── LlamaId.md
│   │   ├── User.md
│   │   └── UserRegistration.md
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── LlamaPictureService.md
│   │   ├── LlamaService.md
│   │   ├── TokenService.md
│   │   └── UserService.md
│   └── snippets
│       └── snippets.json
├── examples
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── src
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── node_modules
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src
│   └── ...
└── tsconfig.json
```

As described in the [Common SDK structure](#common-sdk-structure) section, the following remains true across the SDKs generated by liblab:

1. The `LICENSE` and `README.md` files are standard.
2. The `documentation` folder and its subfolders.
3. The folder containing the example program that quickly demonstrates the SDK in use.

liblab implements a consistent standard for organizing code and documentation across the SDKs it generates. As you've seen, the SDK structures for these three languages share more similarities than differences, providing a unified experience. However, there are also important language-specific differences that you should be aware of, which we'll explore in the next section.

## SDK language-specific structures

Each language has its approach to separation of concerns (SoC), ensuring that components like data models, services, and utilities are organized according to the language's best practices. liblab adheres to these conventions, providing SDK structures that naturally fit within the development standards of each supported language.

For example, in the Python SDK, the `src/my_ex1_sdk` directory houses the core SDK files, with a clear separation between models, services, and utilities. This organization follows Python's traditional approach, where components are kept in distinct subfolders, supporting maintainability and readability.

While liblab maintains a consistent structure across the SDKs it generates, each programming language has unique conventions that influence how the SDK's core code is organized. For example, the `src` folder is a standard convention in many languages, and liblab adheres to this when appropriate. This is true and applicable to Python and TypeScript. liblab generates SDK structure for both languages that utilize the `src` naming convention for their core SDK folder.

│   ├── models
│   ├── services
│   └── snippets

        │   └── utils
        ├── net
        │   ├── environment
        │   ├── headers
        │   ├── request_chain
        │   │   └── handlers
        │   └── transport
        └── services
            └── utils
```

```
typescript
├── documentation
│   ├── models
│   ├── services
│   └── snippets
├── examples
│   └── src
├── node_modules
└── src
    ├── http
    │   ├── handlers
    │   ├── hooks
    │   ├── serialization
    │   └── transport
    └── services
        ├── llama
        │   └── models
        ├── llama-picture
        │   └── models
        ├── token
        │   └── models
        └── user
            └── models
```

However, for languages with different conventions, liblab uses the `sdkName` property from the configuration file to name the main SDK folder, formatting it according to the language's standards—such as Pascal case for C# or Snake case for Python.

```
csharp
├── Example
├── MyEx1Sdk
│   ├── Config
│   ├── Http
│   │   ├── Handlers
│   │   └── Serialization
│   ├── Json
│   ├── Models
│   └── Services
└── documentation
    ├── models
    ├── services
    └── snippets
```

Python's SDK structure uses both `src` and the value of the `sdkName` property from the liblab config file.

```
python
├── documentation
│   ├── ...
├── examples
└── src
    └── my_ex1_sdk
        ├── ...
        ├── models
        └── services
```

By aligning with these established practices, liblab ensures that its generated SDKs are consistent and adaptable to the unique demands of each programming language, making them easier to extend, modify, and integrate into your projects.
