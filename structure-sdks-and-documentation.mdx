# Structure and Documentation of the Generated SDKs

When creating new SDKs, liblab generates a folder for each language you've chosen to create an SDK for. Understanding the structure of these generated folders is key to making the most of your SDKs. Whether you're helping end users integrate seamlessly with your API or using the SDK in your own development, knowing how everything is organized will ensure smoother implementation.

This guide provides an overview of the common elements across all SDKs created by liblab, along with language-specific details for each supported programming language.

## Common SDK structure

liblab-generated SDKs follow a consistent structure across different programming languages, making it easier to work with multiple SDKs. Each SDK includes the following key components:

### LICENSE 
The `LICENSE` file outlines the SDK's licensing terms and usage guidelines, ensuring that users understand their rights and obligations when using the software.

### README 
The `README.md` file is the starting point for integrating the SDK. It provides guidance on how to get up and running with the SDK and the API it wraps. The content is customized for each SDK’s programming language, ensuring that the examples and instructions follow best practices. Typically, this file includes:

- **Installation Instructions:** Step-by-step guidance on how to install the SDK in your target environment.
- **Authentication Setup:** Instructions on setting up authentication to securely access the API.
- **Sample Usage:** Code snippets that show how to interact with the API, helping users quickly grasp and implement key functionality.
- **Documentation Overview:** Links to in-depth documentation within the SDK, covering services and models that provide detailed insights into the available API resources and operations.

### Documentation folder
The `documentation` folder is a crucial part of each SDK, containing detailed Markdown files that cover the resources and methods defined in the API specification. These files are linked from the `README.md` to offer basic documentation for interacting with the API via the SDK. This structure is especially beneficial when hosting your SDK on platforms like GitHub, where Markdown files are rendered for easy navigation and accessibility. The folder includes the following subfolders:

- **`models`:** Contains the API resources, representing the data structures defined in the API specification.
- **`services`:** Documents the methods or operations associated with each resource, explaining how to interact with the API endpoints.
- **`snippets`:** Provides [code snippets](https://developers.liblab.com/sdk-docs/sdk-docs-overview#sdk-snippets), either as multiple Markdown files or a single JSON file, depending on your configuration. This folder is included only if you [configure liblab to include SDK snippets in the generated documentation](https://developers.liblab.com/sdk-docs/generate-docs#generate-sdk-snippets).

### Example folder
Each SDK includes an `examples` (or `Example`) folder to help you quickly get started. Inside, you'll find [a simple, runnable example code](https://developers.liblab.com/get-started/quickstart-generate-sdk#run-an-example) demonstrating how to easily use the SDK to call an API endpoint. This allows you to test the SDK without having to build an application yourself.

### Source Code Organization (src)
Most SDKs include a `src` folder, or one named after the [`sdkName`](https://developers.liblab.com/cli/config-file-overview-root#sdkname) value in your liblab configuration file. This folder holds the core implementation of the SDK, organized into the following subfolders:

- **`models`:** Contains classes that represent the data structures defined in the API spec (e.g., `Llama`, `ApiToken`).
- **`services`:** Contains classes with methods to interact with the API endpoints, aligning with the operations specified in the API spec.

> This structure makes it easier to find and work with different parts of the SDK, whether you're adding new features or debugging existing ones.

## Common SDK structures
A separate folder will be generated for each SDK language specified in your liblab configuration file. The liblab configuration file provides the following languages as examples:

{/* ADD DOCUSAURUS TABS HERE AND MAYBE ACCORDION*/}
For C#, this is the generated SDK structure:
```
csharp
├── Example
│   ├── Example.csproj
│   └── Program.cs
├── LICENSE
├── MyEx1Sdk
│   ├── ...
│   ├── Models
│   └── Services
├── README.md
├── documentation
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── ApiToken.md
│   │   ├── ApiTokenRequest.md
│   │   ├── Llama.md
│   │   ├── LlamaColor.md
│   │   ├── LlamaCreate.md
│   │   ├── LlamaId.md
│   │   ├── User.md
│   │   └── UserRegistration.md
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── LlamaPictureService.md
│   │   ├── LlamaService.md
│   │   ├── TokenService.md
│   │   └── UserService.md
│   └── snippets
│       └── snippets.json
└── install.sh
```

And this is Python's SDK structure:
```
python
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── documentation
│   ├── models
│   │   ├── ApiToken.md
│   │   ├── ApiTokenRequest.md
│   │   ├── Llama.md

│   │   ├── LlamaCreate.md
│   │   ├── LlamaId.md
│   │   ├── User.md
│   │   └── UserRegistration.md
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── LlamaPictureService.md
│   │   ├── LlamaService.md
│   │   ├── TokenService.md
│   │   └── UserService.md
│   └── snippets
│       └── snippets.json
├── examples
│   ├── install.cmd
│   ├── install.sh
│   └── sample.py
├── install.cmd
├── install.sh
├── pyproject.toml
└── src
    └── my_ex1_sdk
        ├── models
        ├── ...
        └── services
```

This is TypeScript's structure:
```
typescript

```

## Common SDK Structure
As outlined in the [Common SDK Structure](#common-sdk-structure) section, the following elements are consistently included in all SDKs generated by liblab:

1. Standard files like `LICENSE` and `README.md`.
2. A `documentation` folder with relevant subfolders.
3. An example folder containing a simple program to quickly demonstrate the SDK in use.

liblab ensures a consistent standard for organizing code and documentation across its SDKs. As you've seen, the SDK structures for various languages share more similarities than differences, creating a unified experience. However, it's essential to understand that there are language-specific differences, which we'll dive into in the next section.

## SDK Language-Specific Structures

Each programming language has its own approach to the separation of concerns (SoC), ensuring that components like data models, services, and utilities are organized according to best practices. liblab adheres to these conventions, offering SDK structures that align with the development standards of each supported language.

For example, in the Python SDK, the `src/my_ex1_sdk` directory contains the core SDK files, with a clear distinction between models, services, and utilities. This structure follows Python's traditional organization, enhancing maintainability and readability.

While liblab maintains a consistent structure across its SDKs, unique language conventions influence how the core code is organized. For instance, the `src` folder is a common convention in many languages, including Python and TypeScript, and liblab follows this naming convention when appropriate for both.

{/* ADD DOCUSAURUS TABS HERE AND MAYBE ACCORDION*/}
```
python
├── documentation
│   ├── models
│   ├── services
│   └── snippets
├── examples
└── src
    └── my_ex1_sdk
        ├── hooks
        ├── models
        │   └── utils
        ├── net
        │   ├── environment
        │   ├── headers
        │   ├── request_chain
        │   │   └── handlers
        │   └── transport
        └── services
            └── utils
```

<br/>

```
typescript
├── documentation
│   ├── models
│   ├── services
│   └── snippets
├── examples
│   └── src
├── node_modules
└── src
    ├── http
    │   ├── handlers
    │   ├── hooks
    │   ├── serialization
    │   └── transport
    └── services
        ├── llama
        │   └── models
        ├── llama-picture
        │   └── models
        ├── token
        │   └── models
        └── user
            └── models
```

However, for languages with different naming conventions, liblab uses the `sdkName` property from the configuration file to name the main SDK folder, ensuring it aligns with the language's standards. For instance, PascalCase is used for C#, while snake_case is applied for Python. This approach ensures that the generated SDKs follow each language’s naming conventions, making them more intuitive and natural to work with.
```
csharp
├── Example
├── MyEx1Sdk
│   ├── Config
│   ├── Http
│   │   ├── Handlers
│   │   └── Serialization
│   ├── Json
│   ├── Models
│   └── Services
└── documentation
    ├── models
    ├── services
    └── snippets
```

Python's SDK structure uses both `src` and the value of the `sdkName` property from the liblab config file.

```
python
├── documentation
│   ├── ...
├── examples
└── src
    └── my_ex1_sdk
        ├── ...
        ├── models
        └── services
```

By adhering to these established practices, liblab ensures that its generated SDKs are consistent and adaptable to the unique requirements of each programming language. This makes the SDKs easier to extend, modify, and integrate into your projects, while maintaining alignment with the best practices and conventions of each language.
