# Getting Started Overview

The [liblab portal](https://app.liblab.com) allows you to manage your SDKs, Docs, account, organization, and team members.

## Logging in

The first step to use the liblab portal is to log in:

1. Access the [liblab portal](https://app.liblab.com).
2. Enter your credentials and click **Continue**. If you're a new user, click **Sign up** to create an account.

> Every liblab account is part of an organization. To learn more about how liblab organizations work, access [Sign up for a liblab account](https://developers.liblab.com/portal/sign-up).

## Welcome to liblab

After logging in, you’ll land on the welcome page, where you can start with one of two options:

- **Build Your first SDKs with the PetStore API**: Generate an SDK using the PetStore API. You’ll have access to the API specification and SDKs in four programming languages.
- **Get Started Building with the liblab CLI**: Check the steps to install and start using the liblab CLI.

Choose your preferred option and click **Start Building**.

## Creating your first SDK

When you select the **Build Your first SDKs with the PetStore API** option at the Welcome page and click **Start Building**, liblab will use the PetStore API to generate SDKs in these languages::

- C#
- TypeScript
- Python
- GO

> To view all supported SDK languages, visit the [reference guide](https://developers.liblab.com/reference/version-support).

> To lean how to generate an SDK using your OpenAPI spec, check the [liblab Quickstart Guide](https://developers.liblab.com/get-started/quickstart-generate-sdk).

After creating the SDK, you’ll be redirected to the API build details page, which includes:

- The last SDK build date.
- The API specification used to generate the SDK. Download the API specification clicking in **SPEC** button.
- The SDKs generated, which you can download by clicking on **DOWNLOAD SDK**.

## Using the liblab CLI

When you select the **Build Your first SDKs with the PetStore API** option at the welcome page and click **Start Building**, liblab will presents the steps to install and start using its CLI. You can install the CLI using of the following package managers:

1. Login with your liblab account.
2. Initialize the project by creating the `config.json` file.
3. Build the SDK.

## Portal dashboard

The portal dashboard provides an overview of your organization’s activity, including:

- The number of SDKs.
- The number of SDK documentations.
- Total API builds executed.
- The number of APIs used to generate SDKs.
- The total number of organization members.

The dashboard also links the [liblab documentation](https://developers.liblab.com/get-started/getting-started) and the [liblab hub](https://hub.liblab.com/), which provides SDKs to reduce your time when integrating with popular APIs.
